> **Live demo:** a hosted instance runs on Streamlit Community Cloud at **<https://rag-playground-prakosd.streamlit.app/>** — crawl a small site, build an index, and try Steps 3–5 right in the browser (the offline echo model answers when no cloud credentials are configured).

A practical RAG playground that bundles five independent Python libraries plus a browser-based Streamlit app. **Step 1** crawls websites into clean Markdown (wrapping [Crawl4AI](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) with a synchronous Python API that also works in Jupyter) and **Step 2** builds a searchable vector index from those outputs. **Steps 3–5** add semantic search, single-turn RAG Q&A, and conversational (history-aware) RAG over those indexes — all runnable offline with a built-in echo model when no cloud credentials are set.

**Naming:** the pip **distribution** is `rag-playground`. The **import packages** are unchanged — `import crawl4md`, `import vector_indexer`, `import rag_engine`, `import artifact_store`, `import log4py` (and `app_support` for the app). Installing `rag-playground` does not create an `import rag_playground`; you import the individual libraries you need.

## What's inside

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| [`crawl4md`](src/crawl4md/README.md) | Core crawling library — crawl, extract, sort, write Markdown |
| [`log4py`](src/log4py/README.md) | Logging base layer — zero-dependency `get_logger`/`configure_logging` (pure stdlib) |
| [`artifact_store`](src/artifact_store/README.md) | Shared foundation — naming, path safety, archives, crawl-result discovery (pure stdlib) |
| [`vector_indexer`](src/vector_indexer/README.md) | UI-independent chunking + embedding + vector store (LangChain embeddings + langchain-chroma) |
| [`rag_engine`](src/rag_engine/README.md) | UI-independent retrieval + RAG — semantic search, QA, and conversational answers (LangChain chat models, offline echo fallback) |
| [`apps/streamlit`](apps/streamlit/README.md) | Browser UI adapter for non-technical users (Steps 1–5 implemented) |

The libraries are UI-independent and enforced separate by boundary tests; the Streamlit app is a reference adapter over them.

## Features

- **Synchronous API** — no `async`/`await`; works seamlessly in Jupyter Notebooks
- **PDF support** — detects and extracts PDF URLs via pymupdf4llm; scanned PDFs via OCR (requires [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract))
- **Word (.docx) support** — detects and extracts `.docx` URLs via mammoth, converting them to Markdown alongside crawled pages (legacy `.doc` is not supported)
- **Smart content extraction** — trafilatura with markdownify fallback, plus supplementary recovery for FAQs, accordions, and product metadata
- **WAF / bot-detection handling** — two-stage detection with automatic retry rounds and cooldown (round 1 uses the standard stealth browser; retries escalate to Crawl4AI's undetected browser), plus opt-in escalation: direct-first proxy rotation and a last-resort scraping-API fallback, each used at most once per crawl and logged to `logs/network_usage.csv` for cost tracking (see [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md))
- **Size-limited, sorted output** — pages are never split across files; final files are sorted by URL path
- **Real-time progress** — browser charts in Streamlit, spider widget in Jupyter, plain-text ETA in terminal
- **Stop-safe output** — stopping a crawl still writes final output for completed pages
- **Vector indexing (Step 2)** — index `.md` / `.txt` / `.zip` outputs into a langchain-chroma (ChromaDB) vector store with configurable chunking and embedding backends (Amazon Titan, OpenAI, or an offline default); crawl run metadata is dropped and every chunk is stamped with its page `Source: [title](url)`
- **RAG Q&A (Steps 3–4)** — semantic search plus a Basic RAG Q&A page that retrieves knowledge, builds an editable, grounded prompt, and streams a language-model answer with token/latency stats
- **Conversational RAG (Step 5)** — history-aware chat that rewrites each follow-up before retrieving, keeping in-session memory
- **LangChain backends** — embeddings, vector store, and chat models are wrapped with LangChain; an offline echo model lets RAG run with no cloud credentials

## Set up local development

These steps install **all four libraries** (`artifact_store`, `crawl4md`, `vector_indexer`, `rag_engine`) and the **Streamlit app** so you can work on everything.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (3.12 recommended).
- **Tesseract OCR** — only needed to read scanned/image PDFs while crawling:
  - macOS: `brew install tesseract tesseract-lang`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng tesseract-ocr-msa`
  - Windows: see the [Tesseract project](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

### 2. Clone and create a virtual environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prakosd/rag-playground.git
cd rag-playground
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 3. Install everything (editable)

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,all]" -e "apps/streamlit[dev]"
```

- `[dev]` adds the test/lint tools (pytest, ruff); `[all]` pulls every library and backend (`crawl`, `vector`, `bedrock`, `openai`, `rag`).
- The app package depends on `rag-playground[crawl,vector,bedrock,openai,rag]`, so installing it alongside the root package wires the libraries together.

### 4. Finish the crawler setup

The crawler drives a real browser, so run this once after the pip step:

```bash
playwright install --with-deps chromium
crawl4ai-setup
```

### 5. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
python -m streamlit run apps/streamlit/streamlit_app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501`. Step 1 crawls a site; Step 2 turns the results into a vector index; Steps 3–5 run semantic search, RAG Q&A, and conversational RAG over it. Outputs are saved under `outputs/streamlit_sessions/`.

> Run from the repo root so the app picks up `apps/streamlit/.streamlit/config.toml`.

### 6. Run the tests

```bash
pytest                      # core library tests (root)
pytest apps/streamlit/tests # Streamlit app tests
ruff check .                # lint
```

**Prefer not to install anything?** Open the repo in GitHub Codespaces (badge above) or VS Code Dev Containers — the container installs all of the above and auto-starts the app at `http://localhost:8501`. See [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md). Or open `notebooks/crawl4md.ipynb` for the notebook workflow.

## Use the libraries without Streamlit

The libraries are UI-independent — install only the component you need and drive it from your own frontend (React, Vue, PHP, a CLI, an API server, …). Each library returns plain Python result objects and emits structured progress / warning / error **events** (stable codes + data, with no UI strings baked in), so any UI can render them in its own language. See [docs/BUILDING_ANOTHER_UI.md](docs/BUILDING_ANOTHER_UI.md).

### Atomic installs — pull only what you use

The base install has **zero third-party dependencies** (`artifact_store` is pure standard library). Everything else is an opt-in extra, so you never download the crawler's browser stack just to build a vector index:

| You want… | Install (from a clone) | Pulls Crawl4AI + browser? |
|---|---|---|
| Shared helpers (`artifact_store`) only | `pip install -e .` | No |
| Crawl websites → Markdown (`crawl4md`) | `pip install -e ".[crawl]"` | Yes |
| Vector index, offline embeddings (`vector_indexer`, langchain-chroma) | `pip install -e ".[vector]"` | **No** |
| Vector index + Amazon Titan embeddings (langchain-aws) | `pip install -e ".[vector,bedrock]"` | No |
| Vector index + OpenAI embeddings (langchain-openai) | `pip install -e ".[vector,openai]"` | No |
| RAG Q&A / chat with the offline echo model (`rag_engine`) | `pip install -e ".[vector,rag]"` | No |
| Everything | `pip install -e ".[all]"` | Yes |

The `bedrock` and `openai` extras now serve both embeddings **and** cloud chat models (via `langchain-aws` / `langchain-openai`); add them alongside `[vector,rag]` to use real LLMs instead of the offline echo model.

Not yet on PyPI — install from a local clone (above) or straight from GitHub, e.g.:

```bash
pip install "rag-playground[vector] @ git+https://github.com/prakosd/rag-playground.git"
```

Import the library names, not the distribution name — e.g. after installing `[vector]` you `from vector_indexer import VectorIndexer`.

### How the packages depend on each other

```mermaid
graph TD
    crawl4md --> artifact_store
    vector_indexer --> artifact_store
    rag_engine --> vector_indexer
    rag_engine --> artifact_store
```

`artifact_store` is the shared, pure-stdlib foundation. **`crawl4md`, `vector_indexer`, and `rag_engine` all require it** (it always ships in the base install). `crawl4md` and `vector_indexer` never depend on each other — so you can install one without the other — while `rag_engine` builds on `vector_indexer` to read the indexes it queries. There is no separate `pip install artifact_store`; it comes with the `rag-playground` distribution automatically.

### Library quick start

```python
from crawl4md import SiteCrawler, CrawlerConfig, PageConfig

config = CrawlerConfig(urls=["https://example.com"], limit=20, max_depth=2)
crawler = SiteCrawler(config, PageConfig())
results = crawler.crawl()
crawler.print_summary(results)  # timestamped folder; primary: final/sorted_success_content_*.md
```

For step-by-step control, use `ContentExtractor`, `ContentSorter`, and `FileWriter` individually (see [src/crawl4md/README.md](src/crawl4md/README.md)). To index the results, see [src/vector_indexer/README.md](src/vector_indexer/README.md).
