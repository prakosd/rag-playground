# Streamlit App — Developer Guide

A browser-based UI for the `crawl4md` library. Non-technical users fill in a form, click
**Start**, watch live progress, and download their Markdown files. This guide explains how
the code is organised, how the pieces connect, and where to look when extending or debugging.

## File Map

The top-level layout is compact enough for a diagram. The helper package details are easier
to scan as a table, and the test files are summarized in [Testing Map](#testing-map).

Workflow content modules live in `app_pages/`. Each module exposes `render_page()` and renders only the content area for one navigation step. The shared page shell stays in `streamlit_app.py`.

### Why a separate package?

`app_support` (`src/app_support/`) is installed as a proper Python package
(`pip install -e "apps/streamlit"`). This lets the helpers in `support.py`, `crawl/crawl_jobs.py`,
`crawl/form_defaults.py`, `generated_files.py`, `session_manager.py`, and `controls.py` be imported and unit-tested
independently of Streamlit — no Streamlit runtime needed in tests.
Streamlit imports are limited to UI modules such as `streamlit_app.py` and `crawl/form_ui.py`.

This package is a reference adapter over the core `crawl4md`, `vector_indexer`, and
`rag_engine` libraries, not a second crawl/index/RAG engine. It depends on
`rag-playground[crawl,vector,bedrock,openai,rag]`, so installing it pulls the crawler,
the indexing backends, and the RAG engine.
The library owns crawling, extraction, file writing, sorted and final outputs, run metadata,
progress events, and cooperative cancellation hooks. The Streamlit package owns form rendering,
browser-session persistence, background thread orchestration, and generated-file presentation.
If a feature is UI-agnostic and needed by other frontends, add it to the core library instead of
reimplementing it here.

## Component Responsibilities

### `streamlit_app.py` — UI shell

Everything the user sees and interacts with. Responsibilities:

- Initialises `st.session_state` keys on first load (`_init_state`).
- Hydrates browser-local session records through the inline CCv2 localStorage bridge.
- Preserves portfolio-modal localStorage timestamps so the personal intro prompt is not shown too often.
- Builds the top navigation with `st.navigation` from pure page metadata in `pages.py`.
- Renders the shared page shell: active page title/subtitle, session controls, language selector, selected `app_pages` content, footer, and portfolio modal.
- Renders the selected session ID, searchable session selector, create-session button, and language selector.
- Supplies the crawler page with shell-owned callbacks for job start / stop, ready results, live progress, and downloads.
- Runs the shell-level crawl event loop, drains background-thread events into UI state, and emits crawl progress toasts that remain visible while users navigate other workflow pages.
- Renders progress metrics, active/next URL previews, cumulative totals + pace charts, and the
  activity log (`_render_live_area`). Its auto-refresh fragment only polls (every 3 seconds) while a
  crawl job is active; when idle it schedules no timer, so an idle or navigated-away page leaves no
  stale fragment timer to log a "fragment ... does not exist anymore" warning.
- Renders the selected session's generated-file table and a per-file download + preview tree separately
  (`_render_downloads`, polling every 7 seconds only while a crawl or vector-index job is active).
- Runs a one-time startup cleanup of old session folders (`_run_startup_cleanup`, cached with
  `@st.cache_resource`).
- Renders the global footer and browser-timed portfolio modal with translated copy.

The current multipage pass uses dedicated modules in `app_pages/` for every workflow step. Step 1 (`app_pages/crawl4md.py`) renders the crawler content area and Step 2 (`app_pages/vector_index.py`) renders the vector-index content area, both through callbacks from the shared shell. Steps 3-5 (`semantic_search.py`, `basic_rag_qa.py`, `conversational_rag.py`) are implemented over the `rag_engine` library: each receives a `RagPageContext` with an index picker, runs synchronously (a spinner), and renders the structured `RagAnswer`/`RetrievalResult`. They reuse the same width, title/subtitle placement, session-control row, language selector placement, footer, and restrained Streamlit-native styling as the crawler page so navigation feels continuous.

### Toast Emission Model

App-wide toast notifications are emitted by the shared shell, not by page modules. This keeps background crawl updates visible while users navigate across workflow pages, because the shell runs before every selected page.

- Shell-owned toasts: crawl progress, background job completion/failure, session lifecycle, and other cross-page status.
- Page-local feedback: validation hints, inline warnings, and page-only status should render in the content area with `st.info`, `st.warning`, `st.success`, or a page-local panel.
- Future pages that need an app-wide toast should request it through a shell-provided callback or context instead of calling `st.toast()` directly.

### `app_pages/` — workflow content pages

Streamlit UI modules for individual workflow steps. These files may import Streamlit, but they should only render content that belongs between the shared session controls and footer. Do not add `st.title`, session controls, language selectors, footer UI, or direct `st.toast()` calls here.

| Page module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `crawl4md.py` | Step 1 crawler content area; receives shell callbacks through `CrawlPageContext` |
| `vector_index.py` | Step 2 vector-index content area; receives shell callbacks through `VectorIndexPageContext` |
| `semantic_search.py` | Step 3 semantic search — carded index picker + `manifest.json` metadata grid (Created shown in local time), a query form with a top-N input (plain closest-match search), an always-present collapsible **Search results** panel (a neutral title + hint when empty; id/size/language caption under the title, right-docked similarity text + Raw/Preview tabs; persists across reruns, opens on a new search), a **Search history** card list (per-session log; each card leads with the query + a pin toggle & replay and a collapsed **Details** 4-column grid of searched / results / index name / index date time and the broken-out index fields; pinned cards sort first; replay restores query + Vector DB and focuses the query), and Output Files (`rag_engine.retrieve`) |
| `basic_rag_qa.py` | Step 4 Basic RAG Q&A — index/model/tone/top-results panel, question → **Generate prompt** (`retrieve` + `build_rag_prompt`, template from `BASIC_RAG_QA_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_FILE` via `basic_rag_qa_form_ui.resolve_basic_rag_qa_prompt_template`; retrieved hits render in an always-present **Search results** panel between the question and prompt via the shared `render_results_panel` (collapsed, titled with the match count)), editable prompt with an icon-only **Maximize** full-screen dialog with an **Apply** button that writes edits back (dismiss discards; via `basic_rag_qa_form_ui.apply_maximized_prompt`) → **Send** (`stream_prompt`, streamed answer shown in an **Answer** panel inside the prompt form under the button + token/latency stats naming the model as `Model — …`), per-session prompt history (cards with a **Details** grid, a collapsed **Prompt** expander, and a collapsed **Answer** expander with the model/token/latency caption; replay reloads question + prompt + options) and a session token summary above it |
| `conversational_rag.py` | Step 5 conversational RAG — chat UI with in-session history and history-aware rewriting (`rag_engine.chat_answer`) |

When a page grows complex, keep page-specific state keys prefixed with the page id and move reusable non-UI logic into `src/app_support/` or the core `crawl4md` package instead of importing from `streamlit_app.py`.

### `pages.py` — workflow page registry

Pure logic; no Streamlit imports. `APP_PAGE_SPECS` defines the five workflow steps, translated navigation-label keys, title/subtitle keys, icons, URL paths, page module names, and placeholder-copy keys. `streamlit_app.py` turns these specs into `st.Page` entries and uses the selected spec to render the shared header.

Keep page metadata here when adding, renaming, or reordering workflow pages. Keep page content in `app_pages/`, and keep all visible page text in `i18n/en.py` and `i18n/id.py`.

### `controls.py` — button definitions

Pure logic; no Streamlit imports. `crawl_action_buttons(state, ...)` returns a tuple of
`CrawlActionButton` dataclasses describing which buttons to show, their labels, icons, and
disabled state. `streamlit_app.py` iterates the tuple and renders each one inside a
`st.form_submit_button`.

This separation makes it easy to unit-test state-machine transitions without needing a
Streamlit environment.

### `crawl/form_defaults.py` and `crawl/form_ui.py` — crawl settings

`crawl/form_defaults.py` is pure Python and owns the default crawl settings used when the form first
loads or resets after a terminal crawl state. That includes advanced crawler controls that map
directly into `CrawlerConfig`, such as the `max_concurrent` parallel fetch setting. `crawl/form_ui.py`
is a UI module: it imports Streamlit, renders the crawl settings form, and returns the submitted
values to `streamlit_app.py`.

`streamlit_app.py` still owns `st.session_state`; it passes the active strings, defaults, and
disabled state into `render_crawl_form()`.

### Step 2 — Build Vector Index

Step 2 mirrors Step 1's shell pattern and is backed by the UI-independent
`vector_indexer` library (chunking, embeddings, and a ChromaDB vector store behind an
interface). The app owns only input collection, the background job, and result display.

- `app_pages/vector_index.py` — content area; receives a `VectorIndexPageContext` from the shell and renders the form, the start/stop confirmation dialog, the live progress/result area, and the reused output-files panel.
- `vector_index/vector_form_ui.py` — the form renderer plus pure, testable helpers: `crawl_result_options` (build the crawl-result multiselect), `has_index_inputs` (validate that at least one file is selected or uploaded), `embedding_model_info_for` (per-model dimension limits + local/cloud metadata, from the library catalog), `embedding_model_label` (tag a model as local or cloud), and `resolve_embedding_model_choices` (order the dropdown and pick its default from `VECTOR_EMBEDDING_MODELS` / `VECTOR_DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, validated against the library's supported models). The embedding model and dimension render above the form so the dimension input only offers values the selected model supports; the dropdown lists `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` first and pre-selects it by default. Crawl inputs are discovered with `artifact_store.crawl_results.list_crawl_result_files`.
- `vector_index/vector_index_jobs.py` — `start_vector_index_job` runs `VectorIndexer.run` in a daemon thread, saves uploaded files under the run directory, and emits `started` / `progress` / `completed` / `failed` / `cancelled` events through a queue. `progress` events carry either a pipeline `stage` or per-chunk counts; `vector_progress_fraction` maps them to a labelled progress bar. `IndexingResult` warnings/errors are emitted as structured `LibraryMessage` dicts (the UI localizes them via `i18n.localize_message`); `embedding_error_hint_key` maps an embedding error **code** (not string matching) to a cause-specific hint key so the UI can recommend a fix (set an API key, configure AWS credentials, check the network, or use the local offline model). `request_cancel` sets a cooperative cancel flag; `drain_events` feeds the live area.

Session keys are prefixed with `vector_index_` and kept separate from crawl keys. The shell
provides `_start_vector_index_job`, `_stop_vector_index_job`, a `vector_index_`-scoped stop
dialog, and a live-area fragment, then reuses the existing `_render_downloads` panel so vector
outputs appear in the same file tree. Outputs are written under
`outputs/streamlit_sessions/session_<id>/vector_<id>/<timestamp>/`.

Cloud embedding models (Amazon Titan, OpenAI) read credentials from the environment and fail
gracefully when unconfigured — indexing then reports a cause-specific error (missing API key, missing
AWS credentials, or a network problem) and recommends the local offline model; it never silently falls
back. The form defaults to that local model, which needs no credentials and downloads once (~80 MB) on
first use; set `SSL_CERT_FILE`/`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` on a corporate network so that one-time download
can succeed.
See [../../src/vector_indexer/README.md](../../src/vector_indexer/README.md).

### `support.py` — compatibility exports

No Streamlit imports. Keeps the existing `app_support.support` import surface stable while
delegating implementation to smaller pure-Python modules:

| Group | Functions |
| --- | --- |
| **`session_manager.py`** | `SessionRecord`, ID generation, session serialization, safe paths, session cleanup |
| **`generated_files.py`** | `GeneratedFile`, `TextPreview`, output listing, download-tree building, activity-log lookup, text previews |
| **`crawl/crawl_jobs.py`** | `CrawlJob`, config building, progress estimates, crawl-thread lifecycle, event mapping |

New code can import from the focused module directly. Existing code may continue importing from
`support.py`.

---

## Event / State Lifecycle

Each crawl runs in a **background daemon thread**. The thread communicates with the UI through
a `queue.Queue[dict]` (the `CrawlJob.events` field). Events are drained on every Streamlit
rerun by `_drain_job_events`.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  state "idle" as Idle
  state "running" as Running
  state "cancel_requested" as CancelRequested
  state "stopped" as Stopped
  state "completed" as Completed
  state "failed" as Failed

  [*] --> Idle: app first load
  Idle --> Running: user clicks Start / emits started
  Running --> Running: emits crawl_status
  Running --> Running: emits page_processed
  Running --> CancelRequested: user clicks Stop / emits cancel_requested
  CancelRequested --> Stopped: thread emits cancelled
  Running --> Completed: thread emits completed
  Running --> Failed: thread emits failed
```

Full `job_state` values and the transitions that produce them:

| State | What triggered it |
| --- | --- |
| `idle` | App first load |
| `running` | User clicked **Start** |
| `cancel_requested` | User clicked **Stop** while running |
| `stopped` | Thread confirmed cancellation after a Stop request |
| `completed` | Thread finished all pages successfully |
| `failed` | Thread threw an unhandled exception |

Parallel crawl progress uses generic event fields from the core crawler. `active_url_count` and
`next_url_count` are authoritative counts; `active_urls` and `next_urls` are capped previews for
display. The app renders counts plus previews so any supported Parallel fetches value stays compact.
Activity logs record concurrent reads as batch entries such as `Reading page batch (5 concurrent)`.
Live charts are native Streamlit charts rendered right before the Activity log panel:

- Crawl totals by second, minute, or hour: discovered, successful, and failed cumulative areas
  with the page limit shown as a line
- Processing pace over time: seconds per processed page attempt, excluding discovered-only URL
  events

For reload-safe chart history, the app prefers `progress_history.jsonl` (written by the core crawler
in each crawl's `logs/` subdirectory) and falls back to in-memory samples captured from live events
when that file is not available yet.

## Start / Stop Sequence

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Initial["Initial load"] --> Idle["job_state = idle<br/>Start enabled<br/>settings editable"]
  Idle --> StartClick["User clicks Start"]
  StartClick --> StartJob["_start_job(values)"]
  StartJob --> BuildConfigs["build_configs(values)<br/>CrawlerConfig + PageConfig"]
  BuildConfigs --> CrawlId["create fresh crawl_id"]
  CrawlId --> LaunchJob["start_crawl_job(...)"]
  LaunchJob --> Running["job_state = running<br/>settings disabled<br/>visible action is Stop"]

  Running --> StopClick["User clicks Stop"]
  StopClick --> StopJob["_stop_job()<br/>job_state = cancel_requested"]
  StopJob --> RequestCancel["request_cancel(job)<br/>sets cancel_event<br/>queues cancel_requested"]
  RequestCancel --> WorkerStops["Background thread sees cancel_event<br/>finishes current page<br/>emits cancelled"]
  WorkerStops --> DrainCancelled["_drain_job_events()<br/>maps cancelled to stopped"]
  DrainCancelled --> Stopped["clear active job<br/>reset form defaults<br/>keep active_output_dir visible"]

  Stopped --> StartAgain["User clicks Start again"]
  StartAgain --> CrawlId
```

Stop is cooperative: the worker is not force-killed. `SiteCrawler` owns sidecars and final
output regeneration so completed pages are still written into the final output folder. The
app does not persist crawl state and does not load any previous crawl when starting again.

---

## Session and Path Safety

Each browser stores known session IDs and UTC creation times in localStorage under a versioned
`crawl4md` key. The same payload also stores portfolio-modal `last shown` and `last dismissed`
UTC timestamps so the personal intro prompt can respect its repeat interval. The app reads those
records through a small inline `st.components.v2` bridge, validates session IDs server-side, and
selects the newest valid session on page load. If localStorage has no valid sessions, the server
creates one safe ID, sends it back to the bridge for storage, and selects it. Users can switch
sessions with the searchable `st.selectbox()` or create a new session with the adjacent button.

**Load Session dialog** — the 📁 button next to the session selector opens a modal dialog that
accepts a session ID typed or pasted by the user. This lets someone restore a session from
another browser, device, or after clearing browser cache. The dialog:

1. Validates the pasted ID against `^[a-z0-9_-]+$` — rejects empty or unsafe values.
2. Checks that `outputs/streamlit_sessions/session_<id>/` exists on the server.
3. If the session is already in the browser's records, shows a toast and switches to it without
   creating a duplicate.
4. If found but not yet local, registers the record in browser localStorage, then selects it.
5. Calls `touch_session()` to reset the session's mtime so the retention clock (`SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 7) restarts.

The button is disabled while a crawl is running (`_STATE_RUNNING` / `_STATE_CANCEL_REQUESTED`)
to prevent switching sessions mid-job. Error messages are translated via the i18n catalog
(`DIALOG_LOAD_SESSION_INVALID_ID`, `DIALOG_LOAD_SESSION_NOT_FOUND`,
`DIALOG_LOAD_SESSION_ALREADY_LOADED`).

Session IDs use a readable format based on the EFF large wordlist. The pattern is controlled by
two constants in `session_manager.py`:

- `_READABLE_SESSION_WORD_COUNT` — number of EFF words per session ID (≥1)
- `_READABLE_ID_DIGITS` — digits appended after the words; `0` means words only

Examples: `2` words + `0` digits → `"boulder_river"` · `4` words + `6` digits →
`"stone_apple_river_oak_482917"` · `1` word + `2` digits → `"cedar_07"`.
Crawl IDs for Start clicks use a zero-padded sequence plus one readable word: `01_boulder`.
Existing timestamp-prefixed crawl IDs remain readable for older output folders.
To revert to the legacy `token_urlsafe` IDs, set `_USE_READABLE_IDS = False`.

All output lives inside:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Browser["Browser localStorage<br/>known session IDs and creation times"] --> Bridge["inline CCv2 bridge"]
  Bridge --> Validate["validate_safe_id(id)<br/>server-side filtering"]
  Validate --> SessionsRoot["outputs/streamlit_sessions/"]
  SessionsRoot --> SessionFolder["session_{session_id}/<br/>one folder per browser session"]
  SessionFolder --> CrawlFolder["crawl_{crawl_id}/<br/>one folder per Start click"]
  CrawlFolder --> TimestampRoot["{timestamped-dir}/<br/>created by SiteCrawler"]
  TimestampRoot --> ReadRequest["file listing or preview request"]
  ReadRequest --> Containment["ensure_within_root(root, path)"]
  Containment --> Safe{"Path stays inside root?"}
  Safe -->|Yes| Serve["serve metadata or file content"]
  Safe -->|No| Reject["raise ValueError"]
```

`ensure_within_root(root, path)` is called before every file read or listing. It resolves
both paths and raises `ValueError` if `path` escapes `root`. This prevents path-traversal
attacks when any server-generated path is forwarded back into a file read. Browser-provided
session records are treated as untrusted input and filtered through `validate_safe_id()` before
they can affect any server-side path.

`validate_safe_id(id)` enforces that IDs only contain `[a-z0-9_-]` before they are
interpolated into directory names.

Session folders whose files have been inactive longer than the retention window
(`SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 7 — see [CONFIGURATION.md](../../docs/CONFIGURATION.md#settings-non-secret))
are removed by `cleanup_old_sessions_with_lock` after browser session hydration (using a
`.cleanup.lock` file so only one Streamlit worker runs the cleanup). The shell reads the window
from `get_settings().session_retention_days` and passes it into the cleanup call; loading or
crawling in a session calls `touch_session()`, which resets its clock. Session IDs known to the
browser are passed as active IDs so the selector does not point to folders removed during the
same startup.

---

## Generated Files in the App

The files shown in the download tree are produced by the core `crawl4md` library. The app
presents those files without transforming their content; when multiple successful content files
are ready, the ready-result button may create an app-owned `final/success_content.zip` archive
for a single download. For the full file reference (purposes, naming conventions, and cleanup
behavior), see [Output Structure](../../README.md#output-structure) in the root README.

**Downloading a folder as a zip.** Each top-level `crawl_*`/`vector_*` run folder in the download
tree carries a download-zip button (the `:material/folder_zip:` icon) to the left of its **Delete
this folder** button. It serves an in-memory archive of the folder's full contents — nested under
the folder's own name so extracting recreates it — named `<folder>.zip`. The pure
`generated_files.build_folder_zip_bytes(session_root, relative_path)` builds it (validating with
`ensure_within_root`, refusing the session root); `folder_zip_cache_token` keys an `@st.cache_data`
wrapper so the archive is rebuilt only when the folder's contents change. The button respects the
app download-size guard (`UI_DOWNLOAD_LIMIT_MB`): an oversized folder shows a disabled button with
a "too large" tooltip, like per-file downloads. Each download is signed with an HMAC `.crawl4md.sig`
sidecar (`ZIP_SIGNING_SECRET`) so it can later be re-uploaded.

**Uploading a folder zip.** The Output Files subtitle links to an upload dialog (`Click here to
upload`). A chosen zip is verified with `verify_zip_bytes`; an altered file or a zip signed with a
different key is rejected in-dialog. A valid zip prompts a confirm dialog naming the conflict-free
folder it will become, then `generated_files.import_signed_zip` re-imports it under the next free
`crawl_*`/`vector_*` sequence and a success toast fires. Extraction is zip-slip-safe.

**Deleting a folder.** Each top-level `crawl_*`/`vector_*` run folder in the download tree
carries a red **Delete this folder** button beside its download-zip button. It opens a
confirmation dialog (permanent, advises downloading first) before
`generated_files.delete_generated_folder(session_root, relative_path)` removes the whole folder —
the pure helper validates with `ensure_within_root`, refuses the session root itself,
`shutil.rmtree`s the folder, and prunes emptied parents. All confirmation dialogs (crawl/index
stop, folder delete) share one `dialog_ui.render_confirm_dialog` helper (green keep + red
right-docked confirm) so they look and behave identically.

**Folder layout under `outputs/streamlit_sessions/`:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Session["session_{id}/<br/>browser session"] --> Crawl["crawl_01_{word}/<br/>one folder per Start click"]
  Session --> Search["search_history/<br/>semantic search log (JSONL + CSV)"]
  Crawl --> Timestamp["YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/<br/>UTC SiteCrawler crawl root"]
  Timestamp --> Logs["logs/<br/>activity_log.*<br/>site_graph.jsonl<br/>progress_history.jsonl<br/>network_usage.csv"]
  Timestamp --> Rounds["round_N/<br/>intermediate snapshots"]
  Timestamp --> Final["final/<br/>primary output after merge and sort"]
```

**Why a new folder per Start click?** Each Start uses the next highest crawl number
(`crawl_01_word`, `crawl_02_word`, …, `crawl_10_word`) and `SiteCrawler` creates a fresh
UTC timestamped directory inside it. Previous crawls keep their files and remain downloadable
from the same session. Existing legacy folders such as `crawl_1_word` remain readable.

The download tree shows the UTC timestamp folder with a local-time companion label when the
timestamp can be parsed from the run folder or `logs/progress_history.jsonl`.

**Which files to open first:**

- `final/sorted_success_content_001_of_001.md` — the extracted content, sorted by URL path
- `final/sorted_success_urls.txt` — all URLs that succeeded
- `logs/activity_log.csv` — timestamped crawl diary in spreadsheet format

The `round_N/` folders are intermediate per-round snapshots. They are useful when a crawl was
stopped early or when you need to inspect a specific retry round; for a completed crawl, use
the files in `final/` instead.

## Data Flow (one crawl from click to download)

First, the UI turns form values into configs and starts one background worker.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  User["User fills form and clicks Start"] --> Form["render_crawl_form()<br/>collect raw form values"]
  Form --> Configs["build_configs()<br/>validate and convert to CrawlerConfig + PageConfig"]
  Configs --> StartJob["start_crawl_job()<br/>create output dirs and spawn background thread"]
  StartJob --> Worker["Background worker thread"]
```

While the worker runs, queued events update live progress and generated files feed the
download area.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Worker["Background worker thread"] --> Crawl["SiteCrawler.crawl()"]
  Crawl --> Extract["ContentExtractor"]
  Extract --> Write["FileWriter"]
  Write --> GeneratedOutput["generated files on disk"]
  Crawl --> Events["job.events queue<br/>progress + terminal events"]

  Events --> ShellLoop["_render_crawl_event_loop()<br/>drain events + app-wide toasts"]
  ShellLoop --> LiveArea["_render_live_area()<br/>status, charts, activity log"]
  ShellLoop --> Downloads["_render_downloads()<br/>file table + previews"]

| `tests/test_support.py` | ID safety, browser session records, path helpers, file listing, session cleanup, progress, job start/stop with a fake `SiteCrawler` |
| `tests/test_support_facade.py` | Compatibility exports from the split helper modules |
| `tests/test_app_smoke.py` | App import/startup smoke coverage and preview CSS guardrails |
| `tests/test_streamlit_boundaries.py` | `.streamlit/config.toml` sets the right address and port; no config leaks to repo root; helper package stays Streamlit-free; page modules do not emit direct Streamlit toasts |

Tests mock `SiteCrawler` — no real network calls are made. The split between `streamlit_app.py`
(Streamlit imports) and the pure helper modules is what makes pure-Python testing possible.

## Common Extension Points

| Task | Where to look |
| --- | --- |
| Add a new form field | `render_crawl_form()` in `crawl/form_ui.py` + `default_form_values()` in `crawl/form_defaults.py` + `build_configs()` in `crawl/crawl_jobs.py` |
| Change action buttons or states | `controls.py` (`CrawlActionButton`, `crawl_action_buttons`) + `test_controls.py` |
| Add a new event type from the crawler | `job_state_from_event()` in `crawl/crawl_jobs.py` + `_drain_job_events()` in `streamlit_app.py` |
| Add a new output panel | A new page-local renderer in `app_pages/crawl4md.py` or a shell callback in `streamlit_app.py`; use `_render_live_area` for crawl-status panels and a separate fragment for selected-session downloads |
| Add or rename a workflow page | `app_pages/<page>.py` + `pages.py` + i18n keys in `en.py` / `id.py` + `tests/test_pages.py`; keep Steps 2-5 visually aligned with the crawler shell |
| Change retention or cleanup logic | `cleanup_old_sessions()` in `session_manager.py` + `test_support.py` |
| Add or change a confirmation dialog | `dialog_ui.render_confirm_dialog` (+ `confirm_dialog_css`) wrapped in a thin `@st.dialog` in `streamlit_app.py`; reuse for any keep/confirm modal |
| Change Semantic Search defaults | `app_pages/semantic_search.py` form + `RagConfig` top_k in `rag_engine` + `SEMANTIC_SEARCH_TOP_N` / `SEMANTIC_SEARCH_DEFAULT_TAB` in `settings.py` / `.env.defaults` |
| Change the Load Session dialog | `_load_session_dialog()` + `_register_and_select_session()` in `streamlit_app.py`; update i18n keys in `en.py` / `id.py` |
| Change the server port or theme | `apps/streamlit/.streamlit/config.toml` |

## Running Locally

```bash
# From the repo root — install both packages (core + app):
pip install -e ".[dev]" -e "apps/streamlit[dev]"

# Run the app (from the apps/streamlit directory so config.toml is picked up):
cd apps/streamlit && streamlit run streamlit_app.py

# Or explicitly from the repo root:
python -m streamlit run apps/streamlit/streamlit_app.py --server.address=0.0.0.0 --server.port=8501
```

```bash
# Tests and lint:
python -m pytest apps/streamlit/tests/ -q
python -m ruff check apps/streamlit/streamlit_app.py apps/streamlit/app_pages/ apps/streamlit/src/ apps/streamlit/tests/
```
