"""Transient Step 3/4 result keys the shell clears when switching sessions.

When the user creates or switches to another browser session, the shell must drop
the previous session's search hits and generated answer so a fresh session never
shows another one's results. These key names mirror the private constants in the
Step 3 (``app_pages.semantic_search``) and Step 4 (``app_pages.basic_rag_qa``)
page modules. ``app_support`` must not import ``app_pages`` (wrong dependency
direction), so the strings live here and ``tests/test_session_reset.py`` asserts
they stay in lock-step with the page modules.
