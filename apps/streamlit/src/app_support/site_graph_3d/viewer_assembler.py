"""Assemble the standalone 3D viewer HTML from the frontend assets.

Pure Python — no Streamlit. Reads the viewer's HTML/CSS/JS assets, inlines them
into one self-contained document (three.js still loads from the pinned CDN via
the import map), and injects the per-crawl graph model plus localized labels.
The launcher passes the finished HTML to the inline component, which turns it
into a Blob and opens it in a new tab.
