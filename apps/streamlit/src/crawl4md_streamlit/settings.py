"""Typed, env-driven configuration for the Streamlit app.

This is the app's single source of deployment-tunable settings — the Python
equivalent of a React ``config.ts`` that loads ``process.env`` into a typed
``EnvironmentVariables`` object. Values are read (in increasing precedence) from
``.env.defaults`` (committed defaults), ``.env`` (local, git-ignored overrides),
and the process environment — which is what Streamlit Community Cloud uses, since
it exposes root-level ``secrets.toml`` keys as environment variables.

Only **non-secret** knobs live here. Credentials (``AWS_*``, ``OPENAI_API_KEY``)
stay as plain environment variables read by their own SDKs, so secrets never mix
with regular configuration.

The library config models (``crawl4md``/``vector_indexer``/``rag_engine``) remain
authoritative; these settings just let an operator change the *starting* values
per environment without editing code or redeploying.
